1. I feel somewhat confident in how arrays work. The concept seems easier to understand compared to some in the previous day.
2. I may review the Ruby Array term sheet to get a better understanding about what is possible with arrays.
3. No questions about Arrays at this moment, but I assume as we work with them more I will have a ton.
